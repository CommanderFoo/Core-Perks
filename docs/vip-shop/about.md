# About

This component will show you a very basic example of how you could setup a VIP shop for your players where they can purchase limited time tiers.  The higher the tier the more rewards they could get.

In the example you will see the player purchase the Gold tier which will give them 20,000 coins, double resource pickups, and a chat label.

When thethe perk is purchased, you will see the coins being picked up will give double.
