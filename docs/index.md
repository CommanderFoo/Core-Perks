# Perk Examples Kit Documentation

Welcome to the documentation for `Perk Examples Kit` found in [Core](https://coregames.com) Community Content.

This community content has various examples of how you _could_ use Perks in your game.  All examples can be drag and dropped into your hierarchy and contain a few options on the root object that you can adjust.

!!! warning
	You will need to setup some test perks to use the components in this kit.  If you don't do this then the Perk Button will be greyed out and you will receive a warning in the Event Log.

Here is a list of all the type of perk examples that come with this kit.  If you would like to see more examples, please tag me on Discord and I will see about adding more specific ones.

 - `Donate (Repeatable)`

	*An in world object that players can interact with to make a donation.*

 - `Speed Boost (Repeatable)`

	*An in world object that players can interact with to get a boost.  Also has an option to apply to all players on the server.*

 - `Resource Shop (Repeatable)`

	*An example of how you could implement a resource shop into your game so that players can get a head start by purchasing resources.*

 - `Title Shop (Permanent)`

	*An example of how you could implement a more cosmetic style of shop.  In this case it is titles for the players that will show above their head.*

 - `VIP Shop (Limited Time)`

	*An example of how you could offer 3 VIP tiers for players.  In this example players get a chat title, double resources, and coins.*
