# About

This component will show you an example of how you could setup a title shop for your players.  Titles are fun cosmetic items players can purchase and showoff to other players.  The title will display above their head and also allow them to change their title to others they may own.

In the example you will see the player purchase some titles and open the title UI to change their current title.
