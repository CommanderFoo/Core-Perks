-- All documentation for each Perk component is on the web...

-- https://popthosepringles.github.io/Core-Perks/

-- All components are examples of how you COULD use perks in your game.  Although they are designed to just be drag and dropped
-- into your game, they are quite easy to customise if needed.

-- Make sure to setup the perks to be able to use the examples.  See the documentation on how to create perks if you are unsure.
